### Article IV
###### Allocations and Distributions

4.1	Capital Accounts. The Cooperative shall establish and maintain an individual Capital Account for each Member. The balance of a Member’s Capital Account shall be credited by (a) any Capital Contribution made by the Member, and (b) the amount of any written notice of allocation of Patronage Dividends to the Member. The balance shall be debited by (a) losses allocated to the Member, and (b) payment in cash or other property of Patronage Dividends. 

4.2	Capital Contributions. No Member shall be required to make any Capital Contribution. A Member may make a Capital Contribution with unanimous consent of the Members. Members have no right to withdraw Capital Contributions. 

4.3	Determination of Surplus and Profit. Surplus and Profit shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be computed without regard to any Patronage Dividends, Capital Contributions, or income taxes. 

4.4	Allocation of Profit. Any Profit shall be credited to the Collective Account, unless otherwise determined by the Bored. 

4.5	Allocation of Surplus. Any Surplus shall be credited to the Collective Account as necessary to bring the year’s contribution to the Collective Account up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the year’s combined Profit and Surplus, or such other percentage as the Bored may determine and the Active Members ratify. All other Surplus shall be allocated as Patronage Dividends in direct proportion to the Patronage Contributions of the Members during the fiscal year.

4.6	Allocation of Loss. Any loss shall be allocated seventy-five percent (75%) to Capital Accounts in direct proportion to Patronage Contributions during the fiscal year and twenty-five percent (25%) to the Collective Account, or such other percentages as the Bored may determine. If a loss is debited to an individual Capital Account that represents Surplus previously credited to the Member in the form of a non-qualified written notice of allocation, the Member will either be directed by the Bored to pay an assessment to cover the loss (resulting in a reduction in current tax liability), or the loss will be carried back or forward.

4.7	Patronage Dividends. Patronage Dividends may be issued in the form of qualified written notices of allocation and/or non-qualified written notices of allocation, as the Bored may determine. A written notice of allocation is a certificate issued to each Member specifying the amount and type of the Patronage Dividend allocated to the Member. In all cases, at least twenty percent (20%) of the amount of qualified written notices of allocation must be paid to the Member in cash within 8.5 months of the end of the fiscal year. 

4.8	Periodic Payment of Capital Accounts. The Cooperative shall aim to distribute in cash or other property to the Members all amounts credited to their Capital Accounts (except Capital Contributions) within three (3) years of the date they were first credited. As a general rule, written notices of allocation credited to Capital Accounts (including notices converted to debt upon Membership termination) will be paid out in the order in which they are credited, with the oldest paid out first; however, the Bored may decide to accelerate the repayment of debt owed to former Members on a case by case basis. The Cooperative shall not make payments that would result in (a) the Cooperative’s inability to pay its debts as they become due, (b) the Cooperative’s total liabilities exceeding its total assets, or (c) any violation of applicable law. If the Cooperative does not have sufficient funds to pay out all funds credited to Capital Accounts for a given fiscal year, then funds will be paid out in proportion to the balance in the Capital Accounts.
	
4.9	Member Covenant to Declare Income for Tax Purposes. Each Member shall include on his or her income tax return the amount of any qualified written notices of allocation (as defined in § 1388 of the Code) at their stated dollar amounts in the manner provided in § 1385(a) of the Code in the taxable year in which such qualified written notices of allocation are received by the Member.

4.10	Unclaimed Equity Interests. Any proprietary interest in the Cooperative held by a Member that would otherwise escheat to the State of Tennessee as unclaimed personal property shall instead become the property of the Cooperative if the Cooperative gives at least sixty (60) days prior notice of the proposed Transfer to the affected Member by (a) first-class mail to the last address of the Member shown on the Cooperative’s records, and (b) by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the Cooperative has its principal office. No property or funds shall become the property of the Cooperative if written notice objecting to the Transfer is received by the Cooperative from the affected Member prior to the date of the proposed Transfer.

4.11	Member Loans. Members may issue short-term, interest-free loans to the Cooperative 
if approved by a unanimous vote by the other Active Members. Member loans to the Cooperative will not be credited to the Member’s Capital Account. The Bored shall have discretion to negotiate the terms of any such loan.
